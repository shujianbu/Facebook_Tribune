Facebook Tribune
================

What if Facebook's news feed was just that – a stream of information which was purely newsworthy? Posts from reputed news organizations, such as NYTimes, WSJ, and BBC, inform people about what is happening in our world in a simple, uncluttered way. Our team designed The Facebook Tribune – a new way of reading the news in a way that makes more sense to readers. Flash Builder and FB API are the major tools for developing this app.
